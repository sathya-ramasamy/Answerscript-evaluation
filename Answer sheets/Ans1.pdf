1. Software project management is the art and science of 
planning and leading software projects. It is a sub-discipline 
of project management in which software projects are planned, 
implemented, monitored and controlled. 
 
2. Software quality metrics are subset of software metrics 
that focus on the quality aspects of the product process and 
project. In general software quality metrics are closely 
associated with process and product metrics 
than project metrics. 
 
3. Scrum is an efficient framework within which you can 
develop software with teamwork. It is based on agile 
principles. Scrum supports continuous collaboration among 
the customer, team members, and relevant stakeholders. 
 
4. Answering the question 
What do we have to do to have a success?’ 
Need for a project authority 
*Sets the project scope 



* Allocates/approves costs 
* Could be one person - or a group  
* Project Board  
*Project Management Board 
*Steering committee. 
Objectives Informally, the objective of a project can be defined 
by completing the 
statement: The project will be regarded as a success  
if … Rather like 
post-conditions for the project Focus on what will be put in 
place, rather than how activities will be carried out. 
 
5. Monitoring is the systematic process of collecting, analyzing 
and using information to track a programme’s progress 
toward reaching its objectives and to guide management 
decisions.Monitoring usually focuses on processes, such as 
when and where activities occur, 
who delivers them and how many people or entities they reach. 
 



6. The Monte Carlo method is a numerical method for 
statistical simulation which utilizes sequences of random 
numbers to perform the simulation. 
 
7. Once data has been collected about project progress, a 
manager needs some way of presenting that data to greatest 
effect. Some of these methods such as Gantt charts provide a 
static picture, a single snapshot, whereas others such as 
time line charts try to show how the project has progressed 
and changed over time. 
 
8. Earned Value Analysis (EVA) is an industry standard 
method of measuring a project's progress at any given point in 
time, forecasting its completion date and final cost, and 
analyzing variances in the schedule 
and budget as the project proceeds. 
9. A virtual team (also known as a geographically dispersed 
team, distributed team, or remote team) is a group of 
individuals who work across time, space and 



organizational boundaries with links strengthened by webs of 
communication technology

11. a. The dictionary definitions put a clear emphasis on the 
project being a planned activity. The other definitions include 
_ A Specific plan or design _ A planned undertaking _ A 
large undertaking 
Characteristics: 
_ Non-routine tasks are involved _ Planning is required 
_ Specific objectives are to be met 
The project has a predetermined time span 



_ Work is carried out for someone other than yourself _ 
Work involves several 
specialism 
_ People are formed into temporary work group 
_ Work is carried out in several phases 
_ Resources available are constrained 
_ The project is large and complex. 
 
12. b. Resource allocation in software development is 
important and many 
methods have been proposed. Related empirical research is yet 
scarce and 
evidence is required to validate the theoretical methods. This 
paper introduces the staffing pattern as a metric of resource 
distribution among 
project phases, and verifies its effect on software quality and 
productivity using real project data. 
The main findings are: (1) there exist different staffing 
patterns in reality; (2) 



the staffing pattern has significant effect on software quality 
(post-release defect 
density); (3) the staffing pattern has no significant effect on 
productivity; (4) the 
effort invested on test, document or code inspection possibly 
explains the effect of 
staffing pattern on software quality; (5) the effort consumed 
by rework perhaps 
counteracts the effect of other potential factors on 
productivity. Preliminary 
heuristics are suggested to resource allocation practices. 
We name these as staffing patterns as follows: (1) Rapid-
team-buildup pattern 
(abbreviated Rapid for later reference). The staffing levels 
peak in requirement 
phase, and decrease in later phases. This might mean the 
culture of excessive 
documentation or design, leading to low ability to respond 
rapidly for requirement 



change. Another possible reason would be to outsource part of 
the system to other 
organization for design and development. In both situations, 
we suppose the 
software quality and productivity are low. (2) Fix-staff 
pattern (abbreviated 
Fix). The team size is fixed or stable across project lifecycle. 
It is likely that 
the same team has done all work. Due to sufficient learning 
time and 
communication within the team, we assumed that high 
software quality will be 
yielded as a result. It is hard to assess its productivity: 
perhaps peoples work 
efficiently due to effective communication, perhaps this effect 
cannot counteract 
against the excessive human resources investment in a 
prolonged duration. (3) 
Design-construction-centric pattern (abbreviated Design). 
The staffing levels are 



high in design and construction phases, and low in other 
phases. The reason for 
low staffing level in requirement and test phases may be 
indifference to them, or 
mature/simple product. The software quality and 
productivity might be low for 
the former possibility, and high for the latter. (4) 
Implementation-centric pattern 
(abbreviated Implement). The staffing levels are high in 
construction and test 
phases, and low in other phases. The reason for low staffing 
level in requirement 
and design phases may be indifference to them, or merely 
providing coding and 
testing services in IT outsourcing market. The software 
quality and 
productivity would be low for the former possibility, and high 
for the latter. (5) 
Test-centric pattern (abbreviated Test). The staffing levels 
are relatively low in 



early phases, but increase in test and transition phases. The 
increasing level in 
test phase may be the result of intensive testing by a special 
team (in-house or 
outsourcing), or fire-fighting for too many bugs. The software 
quality may be high, 
because the staffing level in early phases is also stable and the 
situation is the 
same as Fix-staff pattern. Moreover, it is possible that high 
staffing level in test 
or transition phase detects and removes more defects before 
delivery. Similar to 
Fix-staff pattern, its productivity is hard to be determined. 
13. b. Formulating a network model 
The first stage in creating a network model is to represent 
the activities 
and their relationships as a graph. In activity-on-node we 
do this by 
representing activities as nodes in the graph-the lines between 
nodes 



represent dependencies. 
Constructing precedence networks 
A project network should have only one start node. A project 
network 
should have only one end node. A node has duration. 
Links normally have no duration. 
Precedents are the immediate preceding activities. 
Times moves from left to right 
A network may not contain loops 
Representing lagged activities We might come across situations 
where we 
wished to undertake two activities in parallel so long as there 
is a lag 
between the two. We might wish to document amendments to 
a program as 
it was being tested - particularly if evaluating a prototype. 
Where 
activities can occur in parallel with a time lag between them 
we represent 



the lag with duration on the linking arrow as shown in 
Figure 6.13. This 
indicates that documenting amendments can start one day 
after the start 
of prototype testing and will be completed two days after 
prototype testing 
is completed. Hammock activities A hammock activity (also 
hammock task) 
is a schedule or project planning term for a grouping of tasks 
that "hang" 
between two end dates it is tied to. A hammock 
activity can group tasks which are not related in the 
hierarchical sense of 
a Work Breakdown Structure, or are not related in a 
logical sense of a 
task dependency where one task must wait for another. 
 
14. a. A project manager is a person who is responsible for 
leading the 



project. In other words, project managers are the spearheads 
of a project. 
They ensure that the project is completed within the specified 
deadline and 
gets delivered to the client without any flaws. 
Here are three simple steps to help you start monitoring your 
schedule. 
15. b. Ethics relates to the moral obligation to respect the 
rights and 
interests of others – goes beyond strictly legal responsibilities 
Three groups of responsibilities: 
* Responsibilities that everyone has 
* Responsibilities that people in organizations have 
* Responsibilities relating to your profession or calling 
Organizational 
ethics 
There are some who argue that ethical organizational ethics 
are limited: 
* Stockholder theory (e.g. Milton Friedman). An employee‘s 
duty is to the 



owners of the business (which often means the stakeholders) 
above all 
others – although legal requirements must be met. 
* Competitive relationships between businesses. 
qual chances for promotions. One way to promote uniform 
treatment in organizations is through sensitivity training. 
Some companies 
hold one-day seminars on various discrimination issues. They 
then invite 
outside experts in to discuss these topics. Similarly, small 
company 
managers must also avoid favoring one employee over others.  
The owner must also maintain certain safety standards for 
protecting nearby residents from leaks that affect the water 
or air quality. 
There are state and federal laws that protect people from 
unethical 
environmental practices. Business owners who violate these 
laws may face 
stiff penalties. They may also be shut down. 



 
Business owners must run clean operations with respect to  
investing and expanding their companies. For example, 
organizations 
must not bribe state legislators for tax credits or special 
privileges. 
Insider trading is when managers or 
information affecting publicly traded stocks, according to the 
Securities 
and Exchange Commission. The information helps some 
investors achieve 
greater returns on their investments at the expense of others. 
Executives 
in small companies must strive to help all shareholders earn 
better returns 
on their money. They must also avoid collusive arrangements 
with other 
companies to deliberately harm other competitors. 
Considerations 



A small company's organizational ethics can also include 
taking care of 
employees with mental illnesses or substance abuse problems, 
such as drug 
and alcohol dependency. Ethical business owners help their 
employees 
overcome these types of problems when possible. They often put 
them 
through employee advisor programs, which involves getting 
them the 
treatment they need. Employees may have issues that lead to 
these types of 
problems. Therefore, they deserve a chance to explain their 
situations and 
get the help they need 
Professional ethics 
Professionals have knowledge about the technical domain that 
the general 
public does not. Ethical duty of the expert to warn lay people 
of the risks 



involved in a particular course of action. Many professions, 
or would be 
professions, have codes of conduct for their members. 
 
16. a. It’s a well-known fact that an organization (company, 
business or non-profit) is a complex system which is primarily 
designed to add value to all stakeholders: employers, legal 
owners, staff, customers, business partners, authorities, etc. 

Any organization uses a management system to determine the 
needs of each stakeholder, to transform these needs into 
internal requirements, to provide the resources needed to 
meet all the requirements and to review the performances. 
(See picture below 

 

There are many definitions for the Management System of an 
organization. Here are two examples: 

 



 

 

Therefore, to have a management system, each organization 
should clearly define its own activities and internal processes, 
and these internal processes must be continuously improved, 
based on the analysis of the results. 

 

We can define the term “quality” in many ways, but the ISO 
family of standards gives a very concise definition: “quality - 
the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfils 
Note: At this time, the ISO 9000 and ISO 9001 standards 
are under revision. 

 

This definition gives a general sense of "quality", but we can 
watch at The Chartered Quality Institute (thecqi.org) which 
gives the following definition: “an outcome – a characteristic 
of a product or service provided to a customer, and the 



hallmark of an organization which has satisfied all of its 
stakeholders.”  

 

So, we must consider the customer and the degree to which 
the product or service meets the needs of all stakeholders. We 
can say about the quality of a product or service that this is 
“poor”, or “good” or “excellent”, but this must be in 
accordance with something, we must have a reference to give 
such a description. 

 

Nowadays, all organizations have to face some challenges in 
their business environment: the economic crisis, globalization, 
as well as the competition in its market. Moreover, the 
increase in technology and especially in IT, requires new 
actions. For example, it is well known that the e-commerce 
has opened new doors in business, which means an increased 
competitive environment. And if we consider the area of social 



media, we realize that organizations that do not meet the 
"quality" of products or services have no chance to stay on 
the market. The conclusion is that “Quality” is very 
important for every business!  

What might or could a company do to provide quality 
products or services? 

This is such a great subject! We could talk days and days 
about it! But in this article I will touch only a part of it, 
namely the one that relates to the Quality Management 
System. 

What is a Quality Management System? 

Returning to ISO 9000:2005, we can find this definition: 
“management system to direct and control an organization 
with regard to quality”. 

In other words, a Quality Management System is “a set of 
interrelated or interacting processes used to guide and lead 



an organization so that its products or services meet the 
established requirements”. 

 

Specifically, the Quality Management System focuses on the 
processes of the organization, customer and continuous 
improvement. 

Any Management System (whether it is quality, environment, 
energy, etc.) is developed based on PDCA cycle model, which 
is known as “process-based model system”. So, if an 
organization wants to fulfill the requirements for a quality 
management system, it must develop its management system on 
a process approach. This is a very important principle of 
quality management, and the new revision of the standard 
(expected in September 2015) makes an emphasis on "the 
process approach". From this point of view, we can say that 
the internal processes of an organization are very important 
for delivering quality products or services. But it is not the 



single one … there are actually, eight quality management 
principles and any organization must take these into account: 

 

Customer focus 

Leadership 

Involvement of people 

Process approach 

System approach to management 

Continual improvement 

Factual approach to decision making 

Mutually beneficial supplier relationships 

Every principle from the above list has its own importance. 
But, in this article I will focus on only the first of them. 

 

The first principle “customer focus” is very important. 
Everyone will agree that an organization depends on its 



customers, and that the organization cannot exist unless 
there are clients who buy its products and services. For this 
reason, the organization must understand the requirements 
of its customers and should focus to exceed those 
expectations and understand their requirements even 
further.
